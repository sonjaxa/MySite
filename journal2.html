  <h1>My Reflection</h1>
  <h2>Tuesday, 7/18</h2>
  <p>- From Erin's personal experiences in college and work with CS I learned that asking questions is the best way to learn, and that had a big impact on me. Never be ashamed to ask because you'll gain so much more than if you were to try to figure things out on your own. </p>
<!--  <p>- The most important thing I got from Erin's talk was to always be learning in pursuit of self-betterment. Always be asking questions, talking to new people, growing, and changing.</p> -->
