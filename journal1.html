  <h1>My Reflection</h1>
  <h2>7/17</h2>
  <p>- Python and Scratch function very similarly, just sans the user friendly interface. All the concepts transfer and work easily oce I've learned the syntax. <br> - Working with and debugging out Python program was a little more difficult and frustrating than Scratch. It feels much more complicated, but I do enjoy the feeling of physically writing my own code rather than dragging and dropping blocks.</p>
